			<p>
In a dim corner of my room for longer than<br/>
my fancy thinks<br/>
A beautiful and silent Sphinx has watched me<br/>
through the shifting gloom.
</p>

<p>
Inviolate and immobile she does not rise she<br/>
does not stir<br/>
For silver moons are naught to her and naught<br/>
to her the suns that reel.
</p>

<p>
Red follows grey across the air, the waves of<br/>
moonlight ebb and flow<br/>
But with the Dawn she does not go and in the<br/>
night-time she is there.
</p>

<p>
Dawn follows Dawn and Nights grow old and<br/>
all the while this curious cat<br/>
Lies couching on the Chinese mat with eyes of<br/>
satin rimmed with gold.
</p>

<p>
Upon the mat she lies and leers and on the<br/>
tawny throat of her<br/>
Flutters the soft and silky fur or ripples to her<br/>
pointed ears.
</p>

<p>
Come forth, my lovely seneschal! so somnolent,<br/>
so statuesque!<br/>
Come forth you exquisite grotesque! half woman<br/>
and half animal!
</p>

<p>
Come forth my lovely languorous Sphinx! and<br/>
put your head upon my knee!<br/>
And let me stroke your throat and see your<br/>
body spotted like the Lynx!
</p>

<p>
And let me touch those curving claws of yellow<br/>
ivory and grasp<br/>
The tail that like a monstrous Asp coils round<br/>
your heavy velvet paws!
</p>


<p>
A thousand weary centuries are thine<br/>
while I have hardly seen<br/>
Some twenty summers cast their green for<br/>
Autumn's gaudy liveries.
</p>

<p>
But you can read the Hieroglyphs on the<br/>
great sandstone obelisks,<br/>
And you have talked with Basilisks, and you<br/>
have looked on Hippogriffs.
</p>

<p>
O tell me, were you standing by when Isis to<br/>
Osiris knelt?<br/>
And did you watch the Egyptian melt her union<br/>
for Antony
</p>

<p>
And drink the jewel-drunken wine and bend<br/>
her head in mimic awe<br/>
To see the huge proconsul draw the salted tunny<br/>
from the brine?
</p>

<p>
And did you mark the Cyprian kiss white Adon<br/>
on his catafalque?<br/>
And did you follow Amenalk, the God of<br/>
Heliopolis?
</p>

<p>
And did you talk with Thoth, and did you hear<br/>
the moon-horned Io weep?<br/>
And know the painted kings who sleep beneath<br/>
the wedge-shaped Pyramid?
</p>


<p>
Lift up your large black satin eyes which are<br/>
like cushions where one sinks!<br/>
Fawn at my feet, fantastic Sphinx! and sing mev
all your memories!
</p>

<p>
Sing to me of the Jewish maid who wandered<br/>
with the Holy Child,<br/>
And how you led them through the wild, and<br/>
how they slept beneath your shade.
</p>

<p>
Sing to me of that odorous green eve when<br/>
crouching by the marge<br/>
You heard from Adrian's gilded barge the<br/>
laughter of Antinous
</p>

<p>
And lapped the stream and fed your drouth and<br/>
watched with hot and hungry stare<br/>
The ivory body of that rare young slave with<br/>
his pomegranate mouth!
</p>

<p>
Sing to me of the Labyrinth in which the twi-<br/>
formed bull was stalled!<br/>
Sing to me of the night you crawled across the<br/>
temple's granite plinth
</p>

<p>
When through the purple corridors the screaming<br/>
scarlet Ibis flew<br/>
In terror, and a horrid dew dripped from the<br/>
moaning Mandragores,
</p>

<p>
And the great torpid crocodile within the tank<br/>
shed slimy tears,<br/>
And tare the jewels from his ears and staggered<br/>
back into the Nile,
</p>

<p>
And the priests cursed you with shrill psalms as<br/>
in your claws you seized their snake<br/>
And crept away with it to slake your passion by<br/>
the shuddering palms.
</p>


<p>
Who were your lovers? who were they<br/>
who wrestled for you in the dust?<br/>
Which was the vessel of your Lust?  What<br/>
Leman had you, every day?
</p>

<p>
Did giant Lizards come and crouch before you<br/>
on the reedy banks?<br/>
Did Gryphons with great metal flanks leap on<br/>
you in your trampled couch?
</p>

<p>
Did monstrous hippopotami come sidling toward<br/>
you in the mist?<br/>
Did gilt-scaled dragons writhe and twist with<br/>
passion as you passed them by?
</p>

<p>
And from the brick-built Lycian tomb what<br/>
horrible Chimera came<br/>
With fearful heads and fearful flame to breed<br/>
new wonders from your womb?
</p>


<p>
Or had you shameful secret quests and did<br/>
you harry to your home<br/>
Some Nereid coiled in amber foam with curious<br/>
rock crystal breasts?
</p>

<p>
Or did you treading through the froth call to<br/>
the brown Sidonian<br/>
For tidings of Leviathan, Leviathan or<br/>
Behemoth?
</p>

<p>
Or did you when the sun was set climb up the<br/>
cactus-covered slope<br/>
To meet your swarthy Ethiop whose body was<br/>
of polished jet?
</p>

<p>
Or did you while the earthen skiffs dropped<br/>
down the grey Nilotic flats<br/>
At twilight and the flickering bats flew round<br/>
the temple's triple glyphs
</p>

<p>
Steal to the border of the bar and swim across<br/>
the silent lake<br/>
And slink into the vault and make the Pyramid<br/>
your lupanar
</p>

<p>
Till from each black sarcophagus rose up the<br/>
painted swathed dead?<br/>
Or did you lure unto your bed the ivory-horned<br/>
Tragelaphos?
</p>

<p>
Or did you love the god of flies who plagued<br/>
the Hebrews and was splashed<br/>
With wine unto the waist? or Pasht, who had<br/>
green beryls for her eyes?
</p>

<p>
Or that young god, the Tyrian, who was more<br/>
amorous than the dove<br/>
Of Ashtaroth? or did you love the god of the<br/>
Assyrian
</p>

<p>
Whose wings, like strange transparent talc, rose<br/>
high above his hawk-faced head,<br/>
Painted with silver and with red and ribbed with<br/>
rods of Oreichalch?
</p>

<p>
Or did huge Apis from his car leap down and<br/>
lay before your feet<br/>
Big blossoms of the honey-sweet and honey-<br/>
coloured nenuphar?
</p>


<p>
How subtle-secret is your smile!  Did you<br/>
love none then?  Nay, I know<br/>
Great Ammon was your bedfellow!  He lay with<br/>
you beside the Nile!
</p>

<p>
The river-horses in the slime trumpeted when<br/>
they saw him come<br/>
Odorous with Syrian galbanum and smeared with<br/>
spikenard and with thyme.
</p>

<p>
He came along the river bank like some tall<br/>
galley argent-sailed,<br/>
He strode across the waters, mailed in beauty,<br/>
and the waters sank.
</p>

<p>
He strode across the desert sand:  he reached<br/>
the valley where you lay:<br/>
He waited till the dawn of day:  then touched<br/>
your black breasts with his hand.
</p>

<p>
You kissed his mouth with mouths of flame:<br/>
you made the horned god your own:<br/>
You stood behind him on his throne:  you called<br/>
him by his secret name.
</p>

<p>
You whispered monstrous oracles into the<br/>
caverns of his ears:<br/>
With blood of goats and blood of steers you<br/>
taught him monstrous miracles.
</p>

<p>
White Ammon was your bedfellow!  Your<br/>
chamber was the steaming Nile!<br/>
And with your curved archaic smile you watched<br/>
his passion come and go.
</p>


<p>
With Syrian oils his brows were bright:<br/>
and wide-spread as a tent at noon<br/>
His marble limbs made pale the moon and lent<br/>
the day a larger light.
</p>

<p>
His long hair was nine cubits' span and coloured<br/>
like that yellow gem<br/>
Which hidden in their garment's hem the<br/>
merchants bring from Kurdistan.
</p>

<p>
His face was as the must that lies upon a vat of<br/>
new-made wine:<br/>
The seas could not insapphirine the perfect azure<br/>
of his eyes.
</p>

<p>
His thick soft throat was white as milk and<br/>
threaded with thin veins of blue:<br/>
And curious pearls like frozen dew were<br/>
broidered on his flowing silk.
</p>


<p>
On pearl and porphyry pedestalled he was<br/>
too bright to look upon:<br/>
For on his ivory breast there shone the wondrous<br/>
ocean-emerald,
</p>

<p>
That mystic moonlit jewel which some diver of<br/>
the Colchian caves<br/>
Had found beneath the blackening waves and<br/>
carried to the Colchian witch.
</p>

<p>
Before his gilded galiot ran naked vine-wreathed<br/>
corybants,<br/>
And lines of swaying elephants knelt down to<br/>
draw his chariot,
</p>

<p>
And lines of swarthy Nubians bare up his litter<br/>
as he rode<br/>
Down the great granite-paven road between the<br/>
nodding peacock-fans.
</p>

<p>
The merchants brought him steatite from Sidon<br/>
in their painted ships:<br/>
The meanest cup that touched his lips was<br/>
fashioned from a chrysolite.
</p>

<p>
The merchants brought him cedar chests of rich<br/>
apparel bound with cords:<br/>
His train was borne by Memphian lords:  young<br/>
kings were glad to be his guests.
</p>

<p>
Ten hundred shaven priests did bow to Ammon's<br/>
altar day and night,<br/>
Ten hundred lamps did wave their light through<br/>
Ammon's carven house--and now
</p>

<p>
Foul snake and speckled adder with their young<br/>
ones crawl from stone to stone<br/>
For ruined is the house and prone the great<br/>
rose-marble monolith!
</p>

<p>
Wild ass or trotting jackal comes and couches<br/>
in the mouldering gates:<br/>
Wild satyrs call unto their mates across the<br/>
fallen fluted drums.
</p>

<p>
And on the summit of the pile the blue-faced<br/>
ape of Horus sits<br/>
And gibbers while the fig-tree splits the pillars<br/>
of the peristyle
</p>


<p>
The god is scattered here and there:  deep<br/>
hidden in the windy sand<br/>
I saw his giant granite hand still clenched in<br/>
impotent despair.
</p>

<p>
And many a wandering caravan of stately<br/>
negroes silken-shawled,<br/>
Crossing the desert, halts appalled before the<br/>
neck that none can span.
</p>

<p>
And many a bearded Bedouin draws back his<br/>
yellow-striped burnous<br/>
To gaze upon the Titan thews of him who was<br/>
thy paladin.
</p>


<p>
Go, seek his fragments on the moor and<br/>
wash them in the evening dew,<br/>
And from their pieces make anew thy mutilated<br/>
paramour!
</p>

<p>
Go, seek them where they lie alone and from<br/>
their broken pieces make<br/>
Thy bruised bedfellow!  And wake mad passions<br/>
in the senseless stone!
</p>

<p>
Charm his dull ear with Syrian hymns! he loved<br/>
your body! oh, be kind,<br/>
Pour spikenard on his hair, and wind soft rolls<br/>
of linen round his limbs!
</p>

<p>
Wind round his head the figured coins! stain<br/>
with red fruits those pallid lips!<br/>
Weave purple for his shrunken hips! and purple<br/>
for his barren loins!
</p>


<p>
Away to Egypt!  Have no fear.  Only one<br/>
God has ever died.<br/>
Only one God has let His side be wounded by a<br/>
soldier's spear.
</p>

<p>
But these, thy lovers, are not dead.  Still by the<br/>
hundred-cubit gate<br/>
Dog-faced Anubis sits in state with lotus-lilies<br/>
for thy head.
</p>

<p>
Still from his chair of porphyry gaunt Memnon<br/>
strains his lidless eyes<br/>
Across the empty land, and cries each yellow<br/>
morning unto thee.
</p>

<p>
And Nilus with his broken horn lies in his black<br/>
and oozy bed<br/>
And till thy coming will not spread his waters on<br/>
the withering corn.
</p>

<p>
Your lovers are not dead, I know.  They will<br/>
rise up and hear your voice<br/>
And clash their cymbals and rejoice and run to<br/>
kiss your mouth!  And so,
</p>

<p>
Set wings upon your argosies!  Set horses to<br/>
your ebon car!<br/>
Back to your Nile!  Or if you are grown sick of<br/>
dead divinities
</p>

<p>
Follow some roving lion's spoor across the copper-<br/>
coloured plain,<br/>
Reach out and hale him by the mane and bid<br/>
him be your paramour!
</p>

<p>
Couch by his side upon the grass and set your<br/>
white teeth in his throat<br/>
And when you hear his dying note lash your<br/>
long flanks of polished brass
</p>

<p>
And take a tiger for your mate, whose amber<br/>
sides are flecked with black,<br/>
And ride upon his gilded back in triumph<br/>
through the Theban gate,
</p>

<p>
And toy with him in amorous jests, and when<br/>
he turns, and snarls, and gnaws,<br/>
O smite him with your jasper claws! and bruise<br/>
him with your agate breasts!
</p>


<p>
Why are you tarrying?  Get hence!  I<br/>
weary of your sullen ways,<br/>
I weary of your steadfast gaze, your somnolent<br/>
magnificence.
</p>

<p>
Your horrible and heavy breath makes the light<br/>
flicker in the lamp,<br/>
And on my brow I feel the damp and dreadful<br/>
dews of night and death.
</p>

<p>
Your eyes are like fantastic moons that shiver<br/>
in some stagnant lake,<br/>
Your tongue is like a scarlet snake that dances<br/>
to fantastic tunes,
</p>

<p>
Your pulse makes poisonous melodies, and your<br/>
black throat is like the hole<br/>
Left by some torch or burning coal on Saracenic<br/>
tapestries.
</p>

<p>
Away!  The sulphur-coloured stars are hurrying<br/>
through the Western gate!<br/>
Away!  Or it may be too late to climb their silent<br/>
silver cars!
</p>

<p>
See, the dawn shivers round the grey gilt-dialled<br/>
towers, and the rain<br/>
Streams down each diamonded pane and blurs<br/>
with tears the wannish day.
</p>

<p>
What snake-tressed fury fresh from Hell, with<br/>
uncouth gestures and unclean,<br/>
Stole from the poppy-drowsy queen and led you<br/>
to a student's cell?
</p>


<p>
What songless tongueless ghost of sin crept<br/>
through the curtains of the night,<br/>
And saw my taper burning bright, and knocked,<br/>
and bade you enter in?
</p>

<p>
Are there not others more accursed, whiter with<br/>
leprosies than I?<br/>
Are Abana and Pharphar dry that you come here<br/>
to slake your thirst?
</p>

<p>
Get hence, you loathsome mystery!  Hideous<br/>
animal, get hence!<br/>
You wake in me each bestial sense, you make me<br/>
what I would not be.
</p>

<p>
You make my creed a barren sham, you wake<br/>
foul dreams of sensual life,<br/>
And Atys with his blood-stained knife were<br/>
better than the thing I am.
</p>

<p>
False Sphinx!  False Sphinx!  By reedy Styx<br/>
old Charon, leaning on his oar,<br/>
Waits for my coin.  Go thou before, and leave<br/>
me to my crucifix,
</p>

<p>
Whose pallid burden, sick with pain, watches<br/>
the world with wearied eyes,<br/>
And weeps for every soul that dies, and weeps<br/>
for every soul in vain.
